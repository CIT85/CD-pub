    <p style="color:red">I've add some CSS that we have not learned yet.
        In the past, I picked up the display: flex method, finding it simpler than working with the float property. With
        display: flex, you activate the flexbox layout mode, granting control over alignment, spacing, and the
        arrangement of elements within a container.<br><hr>
    <p>
        image-container { <br>
        display: flex;<br>
        flex-wrap: wrap;<br>
        justify-content: center;<br>
    </p>
    }</p>
    <p style="color:red">Also, I  used display:none because I was getting this error: <hr> <b>

        
        Warning: Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections, or else use a div element instead for any cases where no heading is needed.
        
        From line 25, column 9; to line 25, column 41
        
        >↩ <code><section class="image-container">↩  </code> 
        
        
        So to prevent an error, I just added a h2, but it didnt look right, so I just make it disappear and its not taking up additional space</p>
