    I've add some CSS that we have not learned yet.
        In the past, I picked up the display: flex method, finding it simpler than working with the float property. With
        display: flex, you activate the flexbox layout mode, granting control over alignment, spacing, and the
        arrangement of elements within a container.

    <p>
        image-container { <br>
        display: flex;<br>
        flex-wrap: wrap;<br>
        justify-content: center;<br>
   
    }</p>



    <div class="renderRed">Also, I used display:none because I was getting this error:
        <hr> <br>
            Warning: Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements to add identifying headings to all sections,
            or else use a div element instead for any cases where no heading is needed.

            From line 25, column 9; to line 25, column 41


            So to prevent an error, I just added a h2, but it didnt look right, so I just make it disappear and its not
            taking up additional space
            </div>
