            <h2>About My Topic</h2>
            <p>This section provides an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI), its applications, and its impact on
                society.</p>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines capable
                of mimicking human behavior and performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. It
                encompasses various subfields such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision,
                and robotics.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>This section discusses the historical background of AI.</p>
            <p>The concept of artificial intelligence dates back to ancient times, with myths and stories about
                artificial beings capable of human-like behavior. However, the modern development of AI began in the
                mid-20th century with the advent of computers and the birth of the field of computer science.</p>

            <h2>Impact on Society</h2>
            <p>This section explores how AI affects society and people's lives.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Subtopic 1: Social Implications</li>
                <li>Subtopic 2: Ethical Considerations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>AI has significant implications for society, ranging from job automation and economic disruption to
                concerns about privacy, bias, and accountability. Ethical considerations such as fairness, transparency,
                and accountability are crucial in the development and deployment of AI systems to ensure they benefit
                society while minimizing harm.</p>
