*added flex box to all the page, 

*added flex box to all the headers and nav, still has the same fell

*added a link on the lost dogs page to connect to the location page

*added a location page, so people can search for their dog. Later I will make a longer list with more cities and states and make the list more flexable

I did not use grid at this time, but i will next time I wanted to focus on one at a time

I've added no images on location page, I felt there was no need for one
